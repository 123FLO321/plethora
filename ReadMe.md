# CCJam-2016 â†’ Plethor

 - A 1.8.9 peripheral provider.
 - Focuses on interaction as well as getting information
 - Utilisies Forge's new capability system

## Requirements
 - Minecraft 1.8.9 with recent version of Forge (I'm using 11.15.1.1902)
 - ComputerCraft 1.79

## Planned features
 - Meta provider system: provides metadata about objects
 - Method provider system: allows interacting with objects
   - Context sensitive: for instance you have methods on just `ItemStack`s but also methods on `ItemStack`s in inventories.
